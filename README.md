# Twin-Stick-Shooter
This project was built from the ground up using free assets found on the Unreal Engine Market Place. The game is a arcade style game where it will keep going as long as you are alive. 

Its features include:
o 5 levels of difficulty, shown with different spawn rates of various enemies
o Temporary power ups that drop from enemies killed
o Music and Sound effects
o Both keyboard and controller compatibility. (Xbox Controller specifically)
o A secret area where enemies don't spawn and you're free to relax by a sauna.

It was a fun project to build though I belive the files could be made smaller by removing unused assets from asset packs in the file directory.
